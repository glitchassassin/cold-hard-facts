  "body": "## Facts and Opinions ##\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the mainstream media is biased. From CNN to Fox News to the New York Times, everyone has their own agendas, their own political opinions, and their own spin on the facts.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the facts are still there, spread out across all the articles, and with a little work anyone can dig them up and find out the real truth of what's going on. That's what we're doing here - digging out the facts, dusting them off, and setting them up in a row. Then, we scan the broader context, getting a sense of where those facts fit into the picture. \r\n\r\nAt that point, everyone's free to draw their own conclusions. I'll draw mine, you can draw yours, and we'll debate whose conclusions fit the facts best.\r\n\r\nSound good?\r\n\r\nGreat. Let's get started.\r\n\r\nLord_Greywether",
